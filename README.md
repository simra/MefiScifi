# MefiScifi
Some science fiction books recommended by mefi-ites. 

Inspired by http://ask.metafilter.com/315475/What-is-the-Snowcrash-of-today

All titles mentioned in the thread are included, including a couple non-scifi books, and a couple dis-recommends. These will be marked with additional notes below. If a book has at least one recommendation, that's sufficient to make the list without comment.  Also, if I've read the book and I liked it I reserve the right to recommend it in the face of dis-recommends. :P
